This enables students to improve their coding abilities and succeed in their sector. 
But many of us stay stuck on the question while working through the code problems, 
and we never figure it out.

This might be caused by our immediate surroundings.
So in order to establish an environment,
created a¬†using a coding platform where you can have a 
live chat conversation with others who share your interests.

# üìùWorkflow and Flowchart of Web Application : 

1.	When the server starts it creates a main thread for listening to petitions and the open port on which it is running.

2.	As soon as the server starts, the port waits for requests from the user and if a request is received it creates a new thread sending the information of the petition.

4.	Server creates a new socket to accept the connection of the user and sends an accept petition.

4.	Once the client receives confirmation he/she is able to send and receive messages. This
communication is made using server(socket.io).
5.	Once the user leaves the chat, the socket of its connection gets destroyed and this process repeats.

1.	The main page is the interface for various features. It consists of practice problems for solving, access to login/register page, contact page, console to run the code and Realtime chat.

2.	Users can access their credentials by login or registering on the website.
3.	Users can enter in live chat by just putting their username and selecting the room. Once they join they can have a live chat discussion on the question‚Äôs approach with the community.
4.	Users can contact us for general purpose.
